# Project Kestrel To-Do and Changelog

Bugs
* Known issue that skipping to next scene works inconsistently, and the background view should scroll to match the current scene opened in the film strip. [DONE]
* Add "Parent folder" button to analyze folders directory so you can walk up the folder tree if needed. 
* Fix GPU non-supported in Github documentation. [DONE]
* RAW+JPG co-movement problem in Culling Assistant. [DONE]
* Frequent failures when running on images with many subjects; find a way to lower Mask-RCNN region proposal threshold to improve performance. [DONE]
* Known issue where exposure compensation still tends to be slightly too dark, particularly for noisy images. Root cause unknown. [DONE]
* Known issue where Kestrel quality algorithm may rank extremely blurry images slightly above other, fairly blurry, images.
* Auto-save may save all folders rather than just the ones that have been modified.
* Bug where un-loading a folder that has recently been analyzed sometimes causes it to auto-check itself. Uncertain why. In this situation, hitting the next arrow to skip to the next scene sometimes goes to the next scene of a different folder, if it is loaded with a similar capture time. We need to make sure that the next scene is consistent with the way that the scenes are displayed in the main view. 
* PIPELINE CHANGE New ML model is needed to correctly handle the exposure shift adjustements.
* Delete cache files after folder unloaded or software closed. [DONE]
* Fix bad UI problem when splitting a scene. [DONE]

Features under consideration
* Add a "Quick Export" system or copy thumbnail system. [DONE]
* Implement "Suggested" system to manually reclassify species quickly based on majority confidence-weighted vote of all scene components. [DONE]
* Multi-subject mode is not handled super consistently. Consider reworking pipeline to store crop exports of all detected subjects for improved analysis.
* Implement "Analyze JPGs instead of RAWs" with clear warning that analysis on RAWs is strongly preferred since JPG compression artifacts can dramatically alter quality scores.
* Investigate GPU support from recent pull request #14
* Alter search "show only manually reviewed photos" to include those with manual culling decisions or species selections.
* Add restore capability that persists after closing/reopening Culling Assistant/Kestrel [DONE]

Test before release:
* Fix to Mask-RCNN Region Proposal System
* Quality classifier performance on revised pipeline
* RAW+JPG co-movement fix in Culing Assistant + test restore capability persists after Kestrel re-opens.



===================================================================================================================

# Version Yellow Warbler Changelog
* Massive improvement to Kestrel group detection methodology particularly for birds in flight
* Removed tendency to identify other non-bird animals and placed behind a dedicated checkbox
* Hidden "Use GPU When Available" if app is frozen due to lack of implementation in current system
* Add check for analysis version, prompt user whether they want to re-analyze an already analyzed folder that is on a lower version. I.e. italicize if version is lower.
* Add "Clear Kestrel Analysis" button to a right-click menu. 
* Add un-group scene dialog box to the scene view.
* Add "Save changes before opening Culling Assistant" check and verify "Save changes before exiting" check
* Fix UI for scene editing view.
* Fixed UI for settings page and expanded number of potential editors to several new options with a dedicated "Custom application" page.
* Fix UI - Live Analysis Page
* Added "Accept All" and "Reject All" buttons in changelog


# Version Swamp Sparrow Changelog
* Refactor code to make it easier to edit.
* Investigate poor performance in poorly-lit circumstances, even if it is just to add an up to 1-2 stop exposure adjust.? - For this we need to finish Kestrel Workshop. 
* Improve star rating system - this sort of punishes people with different equipment by setting all their photos to "1 star" and thus making the system pretty bad. Add a normalization option in settings that essentially fits the ratings distribution folder-wide to a uniform distribution with 20% splits. this would make sure the star ratings cover the entire breadth of the folder and propbably improve culling performance too ? Default = within folder normalization
* test new exposure correction algorithm
* implemented database correction
* Consider making the auto-grouping threshold an adjustable analysis setting and storing timestamp metadata for future use in a timeline view. And consider changing scene naming (from #123) to reflect timestamp of the first img in the scene and then you can group it by hour? That'd be sick. Let's do that as a much more intuitive main interface. Will need a database upgrade though.
* Fix scene tags issue
* Setting to control false positivity rate.
* RAW preview within visualizer


# Version Lincoln Sparrow Changelog
* Major update: Substantial improvements to quality estimation using a new machine learning model.
    - New exposure compensation algorithm applies exposure compensation to improve quality estimation performance in bright and dim images.
    - New machine learning model reflects these changes in the quality determination pipeline.
* New rating normalization algorithms let you control Kestrel's auto-determined ratings. Look for these options under "Settings" 
* Significant improvements to group detection methodology should reduce the number of false groupings.
* Several bug fixes and UI improvements
    - Fixed bugs with RAW preview handling on MacOS devices being blurry
    - Fixed bugs with inconsistent application of exposure correction algorithm
    - Fixed bugs preventing the user interface from updating to reflect newly analyzed images while analysis is in progress.
    - Fixed bugs in user interface related to the new split scene and scene tag modification system
    - Fixed a bug where the ETA calculation would not update when resuming analysis of a folder that has previously been started
    - Improved UI by reorganizing settings menu and providing several options to customize analysis parameters.
    - Improved UI to show max star rating rather than max Quality
    - Improved UI to implement auto-save functionality by default.
    - Improved UI to offer more information when a new version or update is available.

    
* ETA calculation fails when resuming a folder that started to be analyzed.
* Massive issues with exposure correction --> Definitely needs to target a higher overall EV and needs to apply to all images for quality esitmation to work properly. Currently any dark photo gets heavily penalized once exposure correct shifts it down.
* Exposure normalization should be global across all images - remove the minimum shift cap. 
* Ratings are showing as 1 star by default for every single photo until a bit of database backlog happens. Fix this. 
* Exposure normalization step isn't really working right. Should target a histogram or make it histogram based (see kingbird photos, etc)
* RAW preview seems downscaled in culling assistant clearly - something is broken there.
* Some issues with underexposed birds being overcorrected too... Maybe just fix this exposure correction algorithm to just shift the extreme cases?
    Bad examples:
        005, 006 in high island 2024 should not be such high quality... ?
* Auto updating folders and that behavior has been fixed. 
* May want to consider tightening mask probability threshold in mask-rcnn ?
* Split scene issue --> Doesn't exactly save automatically. The save changes feature isn't exactly working too well. I think we should just make it auto-save all changes and just maintain the revert changes button. 
* Improve culling.html so that default behavior on unrated scenes is to reject with user-customizable option within the culling options. 
* refresh behavior keeps refreshing when paused.
* Some group detection failures in low-feature-point space. (ex. scene #30 high island 2024) - fixed


# Version Willow Ptarmigan Changelog
* Major improvements to Kestrel User Interface! Kestrel now shows your scenes in a filmstrip style view, allowing you to rapidly relive your memories and select which ones to edit and share.
    - New keyboard shortcuts let you rapidly flick through a scene and seamless advance to previous/next scenes.
    - New accept/reject tagging system lets you make culling decisions from the scene visualizer
    - Streamlined user interface maintains all functionality: rename the scene, edit tags, split the scene into multiple scenes, and view RAW previews.
* Improvements to Kestrel Culling Assistant and handling of culling decisions
    - New streamlined user interface allows you to drag and drop images in addition to using Shift+Click
    - New buttons to reset Culling Decisions allow you to reset Accept/Reject Ratings
* Significant improvements to Kestrel's analysis pipeline
    - New configurable rating system lets you customize how Kestrel assigns star ratings to your scenes.
    - New exposure compensation algorithm improves analysis options
    - Fixed bugs with Kestrel's scene grouping algorithm.
* Other User Interface tweaks
    - Consolidated buttons in the main GUI
    - Updated in-app tutorials to thoroughly explain all new features and workflows
    - Improvements to how Kestrel writes metadata to align more consistently with visuals.
    - Tweaks to simplify language around metadata and culling categories.
    - Improved handling of auto-generated ratings and auto-generated culling decisions to enhance consistency and decouple the two features.
    - Show pipeline version in addition to standard version control.
* Substantial number of bug fixes, particularly around the user interface, settings menu, and culling assistant.
